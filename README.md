# Mr Clean Data

**Mr Clean Data** is a Python application designed to analyze datasets in CSV or XLSX format to identify if they require cleaning. The core functionality includes:

- **Missing Data Detection**: Checks for null or empty values in the dataset.
- **Data Type Consistency**: Verifies if column data types are uniform or if there's inconsistency.
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identifies any duplicate rows in the dataset.
- **Outlier Analysis**: Uses basic statistical methods (Z-score) to find potential outliers in numeric columns.

This initial implementation provides a foundation for a user-friendly tool that helps in preliminary data quality assessment, setting the stage for more advanced data cleaning operations.
